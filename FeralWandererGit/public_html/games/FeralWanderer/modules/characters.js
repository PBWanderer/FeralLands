/* 
 * This file defines the basics of all of the game's characters.
 * Generic town NPCs, monsters, gene-erated family, and the player character.
 * The PC in particular might need a separate file if they're too complex...
 * Anyways, as was said, this contains the BASICS of the characters.
 * High-detail (or most, if not ALL) characters are probably going to extend off of these classes, all the time.
 * 
 * Another thing to note is that the basics are going to get updated A LOT with the additions
 * of new animals, their possible body types, and the sheer number of possible sex scene combinations.
 * Granted, some positions like cowgirl and basic blowjobs are probably easy to adapt and give slightly unique details,
 * but there WILL be ridiculous positions that require deep, special descriptions to really nail.
