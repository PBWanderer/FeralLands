/* 
 * The code inside items.js is expected to follow a format defined by inventory.js
 * As a result, each items.js should be tailored for your game. Sometimes, inventory.js requires tweaks, too.
 * 
 * Note: Should I turn this into a .json file instead, which has a parser that allows invoking functions on item use...?
