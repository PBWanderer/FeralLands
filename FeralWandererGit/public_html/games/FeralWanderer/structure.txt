Un-scatter your thoughts already and fix this all up, me!

Modules holds various things used for your game's particular programming.
This can include intricate body systems, combat systems, and whatever else your game can come up with.

Data holds all things that need to be saved.
World flags, player character, inventory, allies, fam,
Subfolders: NPCs, player, eventdata
'npcs' contains the data on ally party members and the fam. 'player' contains their character data and inventory.
'eventdata' holds world flags and various NPC character flags.

Graphics holds just that - .jpg or .png files that can enhance the game experience.

World holds everything related to the game world.
Items, characters, areas, and how to interact with all of them.
Subfolders: areas, characters, events.
'areas' contains area data as well as an ugly little master file for item data. 'characters' holds NPC data for spawning them in.
'events' contains, of course, event data. Since areas use event pools, events can be separated.

(note: program events to have several different conditions that allow them to never be encountered, depending on world flags)
